* [BramblDart][], from which this package is compiled, can be used as a Dart library. Running BramblDart on the Dart VM is substantially faster than running the pure JavaScript version, so this may
  be appropriate for performance-sensitive applications. The Dart API is also
  (currently) more user-friendly than the JavaScript API. See
  [the Dart BramblDart README][Using Dart BramblDart] for details on how to use it.
